# Raspberry-Pi-project

In the fourth year, I had a course called "Linux and Python with Raspberry Pi." In that course, we learned to use Raspberry Pi, operate Linux, and code in Python. The final project was to program an Analog computer based on a Raspberry Pi according to the following format:
The computer will perform different mathematical operations on two operands, A & B, received through the input/output of a Raspberry Pi when each variable, the type of operation, and the final result are analog voltages between 0 to 3.3V.
In addition, the type of operation, the operands, and the result will be displayed on the LCD.
